## Executive Summary

We tested three different datasets for our Hidden Markov Model weather prediction:

1. **Seattle Weather Dataset** (Real data)
2. **Synthetic Weather Dataset** (Generated data)
3. **Combined Dataset** (Seattle + Synthetic)

The **Combined Dataset** achieved the best performance with 58.4% accuracy.
